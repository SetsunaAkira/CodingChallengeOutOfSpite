Coding Challenge I bombed for an interview in the past, redone in a language I'm more familiar of


The prompt was literally just "For a given array, tell how many unique numbers there are, and also tell the total amount of duplicates"
For example: in the array [1,2,5,5,2,3], there are 4 unique numbers being 1,2,5, and 3, and there are a total of 2 duplicates, 1 duplicate of 2 and 1 duplicate of 5.
I bombed this prompt purely because of both the anxiety of someone watching me code, being rusty in Javascript at the time of doing this prompt, and me having no idea
How exactly to do most of the simple things in Javascript because once again, I was really rusty. I knew exactly how I would execute it in my thought process and after
about a year since that basic prompt, its now here.
